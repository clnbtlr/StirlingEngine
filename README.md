# StirlingEngine

Repository for a low-cost demonstration of a modified desktop stirling engine. An arduino micro is used to measure the engines internal pressure and flywheel angle. This data can then be imported into matlab to perform a thermodynamic analysis of the engine to calculate the heat and work.

Zero position needs to be set correctly so during operation, the measured angle increases.
